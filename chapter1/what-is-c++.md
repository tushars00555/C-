# What is C++

C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.

C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

## Object-Oriented Programming \(OOPs\)

C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object oriented programming used in C++ are:

1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction

## Standard Libraries

Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:

* The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
* The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
* The Standard Template Library \(STL\) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.

## Usage of C++

By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

* Window application
* Client-Server application
* Device drivers
* Embedded firmware etc

# C vs C++

|  |  |  | C | C++ |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C follows the ** procedural style programming.** | supports both **procedural and object oriented.** |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | Data is less secured in C. | In C++, you can use modifiers for class members to make it  inaccessible for outside users. |
|  |  |  | C follows the **top-down approach.** | C++ follows the **bottom-up approach.** |
|  |  |  | In C, **scanf\(\) and printf\(\) ** are mainly used for input/output | C++ mainly uses stream **cin and cout ** to perform input and output operations. |
|  |  |  | C programs are divided into **procedures and modules** | C++ programs are divided into **functions and classes.** |
|  |  |  | C does not provide the feature of namespace. | C++ supports the feature of namespace |
|  |  |  | Exception handling is not easy in C. It has to perform using other functions. | C++ provides exception handling using Try and Catch          block. |
|  |  |  | C does not support reference variables | C++ supports reference variables |
|  |  |  | In C, you can't use functions in structure. | In C++, you can use functions in structure. |
