# C++ Program

Before starting the abcd of C++ language, you need to learn how to write, compile and run the first C++ program.

To write the first C++ program, open the C++ console and write the following code:

\#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;

\#include&lt;conio.h&gt;

void main\(\) {  

clrscr\(\);  

cout &lt;&lt;"Welcome to C++ Programming.";   

getch\(\);  

}  

**\#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;** includes the **standard input output** library functions. It provides **cin** and **cout** methods for reading from input and writing to output respectively.

**\#include** includes the **console input output** library functions. The getch\(\) function is defined in conio.h file.

**void main\(\)** The **main\(\) function is the entry point of every program** in C++ language. The void keyword specifies that it returns no value.

**cout &lt;&lt; "Welcome to C++ Programming."** is **used to print the data "Welcome to C++ Programming."** on the console.

**getch\(\)** The getch\(\) function **asks for a single character**. Until you press any key, it blocks the screen.
