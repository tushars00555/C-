# C++ Variable

A variable is a name of memory location. It is used to store data. Its value can be changed and it can be reused many times.

It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily identified.

The example of declaring variable is given below:

int x;    

float y;    

char z;    

Here, x, y, z are variables and int, float, char are data types.

We can also provide values while declaring the variables as given below:

int  x=5,b=10;  //declaring 2 variable of integer type  

float f=30.8;    

char c='A' ; 

## Rules for defining variables

A variable can have alphabets, digits and underscore.

A variable name can start with alphabet and underscore only. It can't start with digit.

No white space is allowed within variable name.

A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword e.g. char, float etc.



Valid variable names:

int a;    

int  \_ab;    

int a30;

Invalid variable names:

int 4;    

int x y;    

int double;
